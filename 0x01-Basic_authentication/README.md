## Project Overview

This project introduces you to the concept of authentication, specifically focusing on implementing Basic Authentication in a simple API. Authentication is a critical part of web development, ensuring that users accessing certain parts of an application are verified. While it's common to use frameworks or libraries like `Flask-HTTPAuth` to handle authentication, this project provides a hands-on approach to understanding each step involved in the Basic Authentication process.

### Project Details

- **Track:** Back-end, Authentication
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Duration:** November 11, 2024, 3:00 AM - November 13, 2024, 3:00 AM
- **Auto-review Date:** November 13, 2024, 3:00 AM

In this project, you will explore the core components of Basic Authentication, such as encoding credentials using Base64 and sending the `Authorization` header.

## Background Context

For learning purposes, this project walks you through creating a basic authentication mechanism. Although it’s advisable to rely on established libraries in real-world applications, this project helps you understand how to manually implement authentication logic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. **Understand Authentication in Web Development**:
   - Grasp the concept of authentication and why it is crucial for web applications. Authentication ensures that users are verified before gaining access to specific resources.

2. **Learn About Base64 Encoding**:
   - Understand what Base64 encoding is and why it’s used in Basic Authentication to encode credentials into a format suitable for transmission over HTTP.

3. **Encode and Decode Strings Using Base64**:
   - Learn how to encode a string (such as a username and password) into Base64 and decode it back. This will be essential for handling Basic Authentication credentials.

4. **Implement Basic Authentication**:
   - Gain practical experience in implementing Basic Authentication, which involves sending a username and password encoded in Base64 in the `Authorization` header of HTTP requests.

5. **Send the Authorization Header in HTTP Requests**:
   - Learn how to construct an HTTP request that includes the `Authorization` header, which passes the encoded credentials to the server to authenticate a user.
